# GitHub Push Instructions

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/rnt07s
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository details:
   - **Name**: `dailypulse-flutter-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "A Flutter-based mood tracking app with Firebase integration - Internship Assessment Project"
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for portfolio) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)
cd 'C:\Users\RAUNEET SINGH\Downloads\intern project\bot'

# Add the remote repository (replace with your actual repo URL from GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/rnt07s/dailypulse-flutter-app.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enter Credentials (if prompted)

When you push, GitHub may ask for authentication:
- **Username**: rnt07s
- **Password**: Use a Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

### How to Generate a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "DailyPulse Flutter App"
4. Expiration: 90 days (or your preference)
5. Select scopes: Check "repo" (full control of private repositories)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** - you won't see it again!
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

## Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (gh)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```powershell
gh auth login
gh repo create dailypulse-flutter-app --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## After Successful Push

Your repository will be available at:
https://github.com/rnt07s/dailypulse-flutter-app

## Verify Upload

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. You should see all your files including:
   - lib/ folder with all screens
   - README.md
   - pubspec.yaml
   - Documentation files (ASSESSMENT_CHECKLIST.md, etc.)

## Optional: Add Repository Topics

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click the gear icon next to "About"
2. Add topics: `flutter`, `dart`, `firebase`, `mobile-app`, `mood-tracker`, `material-design`
3. Add the description from Step 1
4. Add website link (if you deploy it)
